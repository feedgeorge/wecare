# Wecare.my - E-Community FeedBack System

## Description

The goal of this project is to encourage the growth of participatory democracy in Malaysia through
the innovative use of web/mobile-based technologies for interaction between local councilors and citizens.
Through this system, local councils will better monitor and resolve problems faced by the citizens;
whereas for the citizens they will be able to engage with the councilors and participate in the decision
making process of local councils.

The current system is designed with Feedgeorge API. You can develop your own API for your needs. In case you need Feedgeorge API, you can apply from support@feedgeorge.com
